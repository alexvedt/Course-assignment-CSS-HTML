A small report: 
As you can see I did pretty much what was in my original design except some few changes here and there. For the first I changed how the homepage layout is because its better to not have too much and in my original design the hierachy was difficult to pinpoint. Now it should be easier. For the store its pretty much equal, except i just put three different jackets to showcase and instead of sold out I did so you can press buy on all items, this i did so we can see what its like when everything is in stock. 
For my contact form and checkout form I copyed the base code from w3s. (its credited) but i changed a lot in it expecially in the contact form to suit my page. I got one error on my test, which was the "fname" type id which i could not figure out how to remove the right way, for now its a minor mistake and should not be taken too harsh. The ui of my website is better in the browser then it is in Figma. The only thing missing, that I really regret not adding previously is a hamburger menu, i would relaly like to add it nut i had not enough time to add it and that my mistake. For the semester project this is one of the first things i will implement in my design and code. I now solved by just removing the "profile" and "chart" icons from the design in its whole, and to fill up the space in the code I added an empty div. OVerall i think my code is definetly sematic in the HTML part - when it comes to the CSS i added an "default" which contains the header and some other basics that would go on all pages.
